Funnel:
Pick Stocks: Figure this system out. Idea: Only trade stocks that we would take a long term position is as well.
Backtest: Figure this system out. Idea: blueshift integration for alpaca.
Paper trade: Use alpaca API for paper trading.
Live trade: Use alpaca API for live trading.

At each stage of backtesting, paper trading, and live trading, we need to log all stats and make sure the system is profitable. If a stage passes checks for profitability then it can move to the next stage of the funnel. This process should be an evolutionary process where only the strong survive.


Data Sourcing: Yahoo Finance API/ RapidAPI
Taxes: Need to think about taxes and how those will get calculated.
